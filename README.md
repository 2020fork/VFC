# VFC

## Codes for Vector Field Consensus

- VFC_long: A full version of the VFC algorithm, where the input can be only two images to be matched.

- VFC_short: A short demo of the VFC algorithm, where the input should be the putative matches.

- VFC_opencv: C++ version of the VFC algorithm.

- VFC_shape_matching: A demo of the VFC algorithm for shape matching.
